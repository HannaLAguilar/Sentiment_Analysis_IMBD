# Predicting bike sharing

This scratch Neural Network model predict the number of bikeshare users on given day. The aim of the project is to build a shallow neural network  in order to understand in depth how forward and backpropagation works. For that reason, no framework like pytorch or tensorflow was necessary.

### Technologies used:

* Python, numpy 
* pandas, matplotlib
* Neural networks 
* jupyter notebook, anaconda

## Installation

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) in an enviroment with python 3, install the following packages:
```
conda install numpy, pandas=0.25, matplotlib

```
Then, run the Predicting_bike_sharing.ipynb
